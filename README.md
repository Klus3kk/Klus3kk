## Hi there 👋

### hello world
My name is Łukasz (or Lucas, if you prefer). I've been passionate about computer science since childhood, enjoying the thrill of discovering new technologies and working on interesting and fun projects. I work mainly in C, C++, Python, Golang (and Brainf&ck if I have a bad day). I love exploring new programming languages and am always eager to learn more. In the future, I hope to build a career in Data Science.

Besides my tech interests, I'm a music enthusiast who enjoys discovering new tunes and have a keen interest in various arts, including movies and visual arts.
