<h1 align="center">Hello World!</h1>
My name is ≈Åukasz (or Lucas, if you prefer). I've been passionate about computer science since childhood, enjoying the thrill of discovering new technologies and working on interesting and fun projects. I work mainly in C, C++, Python, Golang (and Brainf&ck if I have a bad day). I love exploring new programming languages and am always eager to learn more. In the future, I hope to build a career in Data Science.

Besides my tech interests, I'm a music enthusiast who enjoys discovering new tunes and have a keen interest in various arts, including movies and visual arts.
